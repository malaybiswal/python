tuples: list which is immutable.
dictionary: key/value
tuples and lists are ordered, but dictionary is not ordered.
set has no duplicates. It's mutable and not ordered.

dic = {x: chr(x) for x in range(97, 107)} . This is a dict
st = {x for x in range(1,4)}. This is a set. Check it's same as dict except not have a Colon(:)

Yield statement: similar to return, but suspends execution of function call instead of ending. It's of type generator

with statement used mainly for doing I/O. Autocloses the file handle and threading (which auto-acquires and releases lock)
